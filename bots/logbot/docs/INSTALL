logbot requires some systems knowledge to install in a production setting.
It isn't a single-step install, nor do I have plans to make it so.

HIGH LEVEL STEPS

Systems Preparation

  logbot was designed to run on Linux systems under its own user.  All of the
  Perl modules it uses will be stored under the user's home directory, however
  two modules must be installed into your system's Perl to enable this.

  1. Install `cpanm` and the `local::lib` Perl module
     eg. `yum install perl-App-cpanminus 'perl(local::lib)'`
  2. Create a user `logbot`
  3. Create `/var/log/logbot` and ensure the logbot user has write access
  4. Install memcached (optional)

Clone logbot and Install Perl Modules

  Perform these steps as the `logbot` user.  This will clone logbot from GitHub
  then install the Perl module dependencies into ~logbot/perl5.

  1. `cd; git clone https://github.com/globau/logbot.git`
  2. `cd logbot`
  3. `cpanm --verbose --local-lib ~/perl5/ --notest --installdeps .`

Configure logbot

  For the sake of discussion let's assume you're configuring logbot to connect
  to an IRC network named "cheesenet".

  1. copy `etc/_sample.yaml` to `etc/cheesenet.yaml`
  2. edit `etc/cheesenet.yaml` and set values as per comments

Configure Services and cron

  You'll need two services for your each IRC network (`logbot-irc` and
  `logbot-consumer`), as well as a single instance of the Mojolicous
  application.  Both `logbot-irc` and `logbot-consumer` log to STDOUT.

  How you achieve this depends greatly on your system and preferences.

  I use systemd to manage my services as this trivialises startup, restarting
  upon failure, and log management.  You'll find sample .service files in the
  same directory as this file.

  Read the Mojolicous Cookbook[1] for documentation on deploying the web
  application `logbot-web`.

  I use Mojolicous's HypnoToad (using the `logbot-hypnotoad` wrapper), with
  Apache's HTTPd in front of it running as a reverse proxy.  Again there's a
  sample httpd.conf file for logbot in this directory, as well as one for
  the HypnoToad service.

  If you want to use memcached configure it with the LOGBOT_MEMCACHE
  environmental variable - it must be in the form `server:port`. eg.
  `localhost:11211`.  After each deploy you must touch the config file(s)
  to clear memcached entries.

  A status page is available on /_status.  By default it's password protected
  with the username `logbot` and the password `status`.  To change the password
  set it in the LOGBOT_STATUS_PASSWORD environmental variable.  Setting this
  variable to an empty string will disable authentication.

  Finally you need to configure `logbot-nightly --all` to run nightly; this
  process generates statistical data and archives stale channels.
